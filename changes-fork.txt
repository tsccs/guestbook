Redesigned for multi-office guestbook capability.
Redesigned the interface a bit.
Added additional entry fields.
  Location, Name, Phone Number, Email Address, Additional Info
Some fields can be required.
Some fields can be filled by by URL. ?location=Atlanta or Store123
  This would allow office specific QRCode scanning to auto-fill the location.
Guestbook entries can be hidden unless admin is logged in.

config.php Changes:
$companyname - Set your company name for title use.
$guestbooksubfolder - code in the URL subfolder, and stay in the folder when changing pages.
$perpagemax - How many guests are shown on each page.
$adminrequired - Is admin login required to view guest list.
$guestnonadminmax - Show this many recent guests, only if admin is required (above).
$keeplocation - Keep location filled after guestbook add.


TO-DO: Add variable for each field for required?
TO-DO: Add Admin option to export results. Maybe even filter export.
